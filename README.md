# RateYourHouse

### Running live at: https://www.rateyourhouse.co.uk

RateYourHouse is a service that allows you to review a property for which you have lived in. It aims to bridge the gap between tennants, landlords and letting agents to attempt to create a fairer property market of higher quality.

The rating system covers areas of the propety such as furnishing quality, landlord helpfulness and value for money.

RateYourHouse, like TripAdvisor, is a fair system that gives an account of both sides. As such we allow landlords and letting agents to request accounts. Once these are verified, they can reply to reviews regarding properties they govern.

Our filter system is clever and can spot reviews which appear to be false and offensive. Reviews which appear to be created against the terms and conditions are not posted. This may include reviews which contain offensive language or reviews created by landlords.
